A 2x2 cube puzzle that functions like a Rubik's cube

The program is run by the rubix.html file in a web browser. Can also be found at cowdendt.students.cofc.edu/rubix.html.

The rubix1.html is just a version to give some idea of 3 dimensions since I didn't finish adding camera rotations. Both function the same.

The cube is split in half with both the front and back faces towards the user.
